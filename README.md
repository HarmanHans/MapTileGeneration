Here is [a link](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/harmanhans/cl3kuvahz000b15ovnvp06116.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaGFybWFuaGFucyIsImEiOiJjbDNrcnJrNXQwMHl6M2twamx2bWsyMmpzIn0.VvcrU-HyvbO9qodlz3_lnA&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#11.96/47.62117/-122.28942) to the mapbox layer that I made.

Layer 1:
![Basemap Layer](assets/layer1.png?raw=true)
This first layer shows a default layer from MapBox.


Layer 2:
![Seattle Landmark Locations](assets/layer2.png?raw=true)
The second layer shows a custom map made from MapBox as well as locations of noted landmarks in Seattle.

Layer 3:
![Basemap with Landmark Locations](assets/layer3.png?raw=true)
The third tile layer also includes the locations of noted landmarks in Seattle, this time displayed over the basemap.

Layer 4:
![AAPI Heritage Month Theme](assets/layer4.png?raw=true)
The fourth layer includes an AAPI Heritage Month theme, hate towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders being an area of research interest for me. 

The area that I looked into was the Seattle area as well as some other areas of King County that also fell into view.
According to QMetaTiles, the zoom range is 1-14.
